- claim: Noaa and IPCC have fiddled with the data deliberately making the historical data look colder so therefore the sharpness on their graph looks steeper. They have removed data they have fictitious data from 40% of the sites in America that no longer exist and they're still putting data in that is assumed
- claim: 25% more crops can grow due to co2 increase
- claim: polar bears aee doing well
- claim: Mann\'s graph is fraud
- claim: What about that Swedish physicist that you refuse to believe because he believes in something you can't prove. A physicist that was in charge of the UN / IPCC data Gathering service that was left no choice but to resign when he had been studying sea levels for 50 years. He was in charge of the department and of course they LIED to show in words that the sea has been rising but the graph that they put in showed it hadn't been rising so they remove the graph. Yet again bad science.
- claim: Apparently the Great Barrier Reef is supposed to be dying, wrong. It is moving because one side is dying off on the other side is expanding massively.
- claim: Apparently the polar bears were supposed to be dieing out as they were down to 10000 but now they're up to nearly 40000, wow, and they're so healthy they're having triplets.
